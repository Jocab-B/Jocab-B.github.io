Responsible for the low-level hardware architecture of humanoid robots, including EtherCAT communication, multi-joint motor control, DDS communication, and joint module design.

#### Key Contributions:
- Developed an EtherCAT master-slave system to achieve low-latency, high-real-time motor control.
- Designed the low-level framework of the humanoid robot as middleware between algorithms and hardware.
- Designed quasi-direct-drive joint modules for high-torque, low-speed output.
